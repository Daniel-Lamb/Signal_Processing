# Signal Processing Projects
This repository contains a collection of Signal Processing projects that I have worked on. The projects are written in MATLAB, Verilog, and Python, and they cover a variety of analysis topics in signal processing, such as:

- Fourier Transforms and Time Series
- Acoustics
- Optical Communications
- Digital Filters
- Image Processing
- Audio Processing
- Speech Recognition
- Machine Learning for Signal Processing
- Internet of Things and Networks
- Cybersecurity Application of Signals


I hope you find these projects useful!
